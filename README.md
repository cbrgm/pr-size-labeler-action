## Container Usage

This action can be executed independently from workflows within a container. To do so, use the following command:

```
podman run --rm -it ghcr.io/cbrgm/pr-size-labeler-action:v1 --help
```

## Workflow Usage

Before using this action, ensure you have a [`.github/pull-request-size.yml`](.github/pull-request-size.yml) configuration file in your repository. This file should define the size thresholds and corresponding labels.

Add the following step to your GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
name: PR Size Labeler

on:
  pull_request: # Trigger the workflow when a pull request is opened or synchronized

jobs:
  auto-label-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Checkout the repository code
      - name: Label PR based on size
        uses: cbrgm/pr-size-labeler-action@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Pass the GitHub token for authentication
          github_repository: ${{ github.repository }} # Pass the repository name
          github_pr_number: ${{ github.event.number }} # Pass the pull request number
          config_file_path: '.github/pull-request-size.yml' # Specify the path to the configuration file
```

## Example Config

```yml
# Configuration for PR Size Labeler

# List of files to exclude from size calculation
# Files matching these patterns will not be considered when calculating PR size
exclude_files:
  - "foo.bar"  # Example: Exclude 'foo.bar' file
  - "*.xyz"

# Configuration for labeling based on the size of the Pull Request
# Each entry defines a size label, along with thresholds for diff and file count
label_configs:
  # Configuration for 'extra small' PRs
  - size: xs
    diff: 25    # Threshold for the total lines of code changed (additions + deletions)
    files: 1    # Threshold for the total number of files changed
    labels: ["size/xs"]  # Labels to be applied for this size

  # Configuration for 'small' PRs
  - size: s
    diff: 150
    files: 10
    labels: ["size/s"]

  # Configuration for 'medium' PRs
  - size: m
    diff: 600
    files: 25
    labels: ["size/m", "pairing-wanted"]

  # Configuration for 'large' PRs
  - size: l
    diff: 2500
    files: 50
    labels: ["size/l", "pairing-wanted"]

  # Configuration for 'extra large' PRs
  - size: xl
    diff: 5000
    files: 100
    labels: ["size/xl", "pairing-wanted"]

# In case you don't want to count deleted lines and files into
# your size labels, you can change this to true:
added_lines_only: false
```
